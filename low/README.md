# Lower-Level Squashfs

This library is a lower level version of the main [squashfs](https://github.com/CalebQ42/squashfs) library that doesn't try to be easy to use and exposes a lot of information that is not necesary for must use cases.

I will try to keep the API stable, but it is not guarenteed.
